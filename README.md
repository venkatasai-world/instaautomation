Instagram Automation Journey 🚀

Posting consistently was always my dream. Since I love reading and sharing quotes, I built an automated system that posts one meaningful quote every day — completely hands-free.


::contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}


This system automatically generates a quote image, ensures no repetition using an SQLite database, creates AI-powered captions and hashtags with Gemini, logs into Instagram, and posts the content automatically on a daily schedule using GitHub Actions.

Built using Python, Gemini API, SQLite, GitHub Actions, Instagrapi, and Pillow for image processing.

Turning ideas into systems. Consistency powered by automation 🤖✨ From code to productivity.
